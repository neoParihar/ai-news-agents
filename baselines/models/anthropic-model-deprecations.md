Model deprecations
See which Claude models are active, deprecated, or retired, and find retirement dates and recommended replacements for models and API parameters.
As safer and more capable models launch, Anthropic regularly retires older ones. Applications relying on Anthropic models may need occasional updates to keep working. Impacted customers will always be notified by email and in the documentation.
This page lists all API deprecations, along with recommended replacements.
Overview
Anthropic uses the following terms to describe the model lifecycle:
- Active: The model is fully supported and recommended for use.
- Legacy: The model will no longer receive updates and might be deprecated in the future.
- Deprecated: The model is still functional but no longer recommended. Anthropic provides a recommended replacement and assigns a retirement date.
- Retired: The model is no longer available for use. Requests to retired models fail.
The dates on this page apply to Anthropic-operated platforms: the Claude API, Claude Platform on AWS, Claude Models on Google Cloud (Anthropic managed), and Microsoft Foundry. Partner-operated platforms, Amazon Bedrock and Claude Models on Google Cloud (Google managed), set their own retirement schedules, so a model’s lifecycle status and dates can differ. See the Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Bedrock (Opus 4.6 and earlier), and Claude Models on Google Cloud (Google managed) model tables.
Migrating to replacements
Once a model is deprecated, migrate all usage to a suitable replacement before the retirement date. Requests to models past the retirement date will fail.
To help measure the performance of replacement models on your tasks, consider thorough testing of your applications with the new models well before the retirement date.
For specific instructions on migrating to the latest Claude models, see Migration guides.
Notifications
Anthropic notifies customers with active deployments for models with upcoming retirements, providing at least 60 days’ notice before model retirement for publicly released models.
Auditing model usage
To help identify usage of deprecated models, you can access an audit of your API usage. Follow these steps:
- Go to the Usage page in Claude Console.
- Click Export.
- Review the downloaded CSV to see usage broken down by API key and model.
This audit helps you locate any instances where your application is still using deprecated models, allowing you to prioritize updates to newer models before the retirement date.
Best practices
- Regularly check the documentation for updates on model deprecations.
- Test your applications with newer models well before the retirement date of your current model.
- Update your code to use the recommended replacement model as soon as possible.
- Contact the support team if you need help with migration or have any questions.
Deprecation downsides and mitigations
Anthropic currently deprecates and retires models to ensure capacity for new model releases. This comes with downsides:
- Users who value specific models must migrate to new versions.
- Researchers lose access to models for ongoing and comparative studies.
- Model retirement introduces safety- and model welfare-related risks.
At some point, Anthropic hopes to make past models publicly available again. In the meantime, Anthropic has committed to long-term preservation of model weights and other measures to help mitigate these impacts. For more details, see Commitments on Model Deprecation and Preservation.
